              Rescuing street animals and providing a place where people can
              interact with animals teaches and inspires compassion. Recognizing
              animals who need help is something that can be learned, and when
              people are equipped with the knowledge of how to help they are
              more likely to act. We are teaching people to take action, whether
              by calling our rescue line or by taking our training course in
              First Aid; whether by making compassionate food choices or by
              volunteering.

                spread this message: when you see an injured or ill street
                animal, call Animal Aid to help. Today we have one of the
                busiest helplines in the country. We continue to educate
                children about how to save injured and ill street animals, and
                we also create awareness about other ways to help animals such
                as reporting cruelty, humane pet guardianship and the compelling
                reasons to go vegan.
